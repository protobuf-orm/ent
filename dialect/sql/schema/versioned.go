// Versioned migrations: planning a change of the schema into a file of SQL
// statements, and applying the files a database has not seen.
//
// It is the half ent had no answer for. NewMigrate can diff a schema into a
// directory, but nothing here recorded what had been applied -- the executor
// was built with a NopRevisionReadWriter -- so keeping a database up to date
// meant the Atlas CLI, which is licensed separately. Both halves are done here
// with the atlas Go packages ent already depends on, which are Apache-2.0.
//
// # What the files are written for is the caller's to say
//
// A migration is SQL and SQL is not the same everywhere, so a directory of
// migration files is written for one database and not for the others -- even
// though the schema itself runs on any database ent speaks. Which one that is
// is a field of Migrations rather than a guess.
//
// Applying to a database that speaks something else runs statements meant for
// another dialect: at best it fails halfway through a schema change, at worst
// it succeeds and means something different. Migrations refuses it.

// particular it does not create the revision table [NewRevisions] would.
